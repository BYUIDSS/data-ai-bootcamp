# Coding Bootcamp Overview 

Welcome to our comprehensive Coding Bootcamp! Designed to take you on a journey from novice to a capable and confident developer and data scientist, this program is structured to build both your practical skills and theoretical knowledge in a progressive and immersive manner. 

The course is divided into three sequential tiers:

### [Tier 0: Basic Coding](./tier0/about.md)
This foundational tier covers the core fundamentals of programming, offering a broad overview of various concepts that form the backbone of coding. These include:

- Fundamental programming concepts such as variables, data types, loops, and control structures.
- Functions, detailing how they can be declared, what parameters are, return values, and scope.
- Different data structures, including arrays, lists, and dictionaries, providing a strong understanding of when and how to use these critical tools.
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), exploring classes, objects, inheritance, encapsulation, and more.
- Advanced Topics like exception handling, file I/O, and fundamental data structures and algorithms.

### [Tier 1: Data Analysis](./tier1/about.md)
Building on the coding skills developed in Tier 0, this tier introduces you to the world of data analysis. The modules in this tier will help you gain proficiency in:

- Reading and cleaning data using libraries like Pandas and NumPy.
- Visualizing data to understand trends, distributions, and patterns using libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn.
- Concepts of Descriptive and Inferential Statistics for analyzing and interpreting data.
- Data Wrangling techniques, such as merging data, handling missing data, and working with categorical data.
- Basics of Databases, both SQL and NoSQL, for efficient data storage and retrieval.

### [Tier 2: Machine Learning/AI](./tier2/about.md)
The final tier takes you into the exciting realm of machine learning and artificial intelligence. It offers comprehensive insights into:

- The basics of Machine Learning, including supervised and unsupervised learning, regression, classification, and clustering.
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm, Decision Trees, and Random Forests.
- The theory and application of Neural Networks.
- Introduction to Explainable AI (XAI), and understanding feature importance and model interpretation.
- Advanced topics in AI, such as transfer learning, reinforcement learning, and natural language processing.

Each tier is designed to provide a blend of theoretical knowledge and hands-on experience, ensuring you're well-equipped to apply what you've learned in real-world situations.
