# Neural Networks Lessons

Welcome to the Neural Networks module. In this module, you'll understand the architecture of neural networks, how they learn from data, and explore various types of neural networks. Here's a brief outline:

- [Lesson 1: Introduction to Neural Networks](./lessons/lesson1.md): Learn about the basics of neural networks, their architecture, and their importance in machine learning.

- [Lesson 2: Feedforward and Backpropagation](./lessons/lesson2.md): Understand the learning process of a neural network which involves feedforward and backpropagation.

- [Lesson 3: Different Types of Neural Networks](./lessons/lesson3.md): Explore the various types of neural networks such as convolutional neural networks (CNN), recurrent neural networks (RNN), and more.

After completing the lessons, remember to do the [homework assignments](./homework/) to apply what you've learned. This will provide you practical experience with neural networks. Happy learning!
