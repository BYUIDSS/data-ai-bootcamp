# Homework Assignment for Lessons 1-3

## Instructions
For this coding assignment, please use [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) notebooks. Ensure you share the link to your public notebook when submitting your assignment.

## Lesson 1: Introduction to Decision Trees

### Assignment 1.1: Research
- **Task:** Research the history and applications of Decision Trees in machine learning.
- **Deliverable:** Write a one-page summary of your findings.

### Assignment 1.2: Understanding Decision Trees
- **Task:** Explain the concept of "node," "split," and "leaf" in the context of Decision Trees. Provide examples.
- **Deliverable:** A brief report or a Google Colab notebook detailing your explanation with visual aids if necessary.

## Lesson 2: Random Forests

### Assignment 2.1: Code Implementation
- **Task:** Implement a Random Forest classifier using the provided Python code from the lesson in a Google Colab notebook.
- **Deliverable:** Share the link to your public Colab notebook showcasing your implementation and a brief summary of the results.

### Assignment 2.2: Application
- **Task:** Choose a real-world dataset and apply the Random Forest classifier to solve a classification problem.
- **Deliverable:** Share the link to your public Colab notebook showcasing the application, including dataset preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Lesson 3: Evaluating and Improving Tree-Based Models

### Assignment 3.1: Evaluation Metrics
- **Task:** For the models you implemented in Lesson 2, calculate relevant evaluation metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall) in a Google Colab notebook.
- **Deliverable:** Share the link to your public Colab notebook detailing the evaluation metrics for each model and an interpretation of the results.

### Assignment 3.2: Model Improvement
- **Task:** Experiment with hyperparameters of the Random Forest (e.g., number of trees, depth of trees) to improve the model's performance in a Google Colab notebook.
- **Deliverable:** Share the link to your public Colab notebook showcasing the improved models, a comparison of their performance against the original models, and a summary of your findings.

### Bonus Assignment: Advanced Techniques
- **Task:** Research and implement an advanced technique for improving Random Forests, such as feature selection or ensemble methods, in a Google Colab notebook.
- **Deliverable:** Share the link to your public Colab notebook detailing the technique, its benefits, implementation, results, and any insights or conclusions drawn from the exercise.
