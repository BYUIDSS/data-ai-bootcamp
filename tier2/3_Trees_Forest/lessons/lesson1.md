## Objective
By the end of this lesson, you should be able to understand the fundamental concepts of Decision Trees and their applications in machine learning.

<a name="what-are-decision-trees"></a>
## What are Decision Trees?
Decision Trees are a versatile and widely used machine learning algorithm that can be applied to both classification and regression tasks. A decision tree is a hierarchical structure that represents choices and their consequences in a tree-like structure. It helps in decision-making by visually representing a set of rules and their possible outcomes.

## Types of Decision Trees
There are several types of decision trees, each with its characteristics:
- **CART (Classification and Regression Trees):** These trees can be used for both classification and regression tasks. They are based on binary splits and are highly interpretable.
- **ID3 (Iterative Dichotomiser 3):** ID3 is primarily used for classification tasks and employs an entropy-based criterion for attribute selection.
- **C4.5 (C5.0):** C4.5 is an extension of ID3 and is known for its ability to handle missing data.
- **Random Forests:** Random Forests are an ensemble learning method based on decision trees. They construct multiple decision trees and combine their outputs to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting.

## How Decision Trees Work
A decision tree is constructed by recursively partitioning the data into subsets based on the values of attributes. Each internal node represents a feature or attribute, each branch represents a decision rule, and each leaf node represents an outcome. The decision-making process starts at the root node and follows the tree's branches until a leaf node is reached, providing the final decision.

## Advantages and Disadvantages
Decision Trees offer several advantages and disadvantages:
- **Advantages:**
  - Simple to understand and interpret.
  - Suitable for both categorical and numerical data.
  - Handles irrelevant attributes gracefully.
- **Disadvantages:**
  - Prone to overfitting, especially with deep trees.
  - Sensitive to small changes in the data.
  - May not perform well with imbalanced datasets.

<a name="applications"></a>
## Applications
Decision Trees are used in various applications, such as:
- **Medical Diagnosis:** Decision Trees help doctors make diagnostic decisions based on a patient's symptoms and test results.
- **Credit Scoring:** Banks and financial institutions use decision trees to evaluate a person's creditworthiness.
- **Customer Relationship Management:** Decision Trees are employed in customer segmentation and marketing strategies.
- **Fault Diagnosis:** In engineering and manufacturing, decision trees can help identify equipment faults.
- **Anomaly Detection:** They are used in cybersecurity to detect unusual network behavior.
