# Decision Trees and Random Forests Lessons

Welcome to the Decision Trees and Random Forests module. Here, you'll learn about these important machine learning models. Here's a brief overview:

- [Lesson 1: Introduction to Decision Trees](./lessons/lesson1.md): Understand the concept of decision trees and how they are used for classification and regression tasks.

- [Lesson 2: Random Forests](./lessons/lesson2.md): Dive into Random Forests, an ensemble learning method that operates by constructing multiple decision trees.

- [Lesson 3: Evaluating and Improving Tree-Based Models](./lessons/lesson3.md): Learn how to evaluate the performance of tree-based models and explore techniques to improve their accuracy.

Remember to work on the [homework assignments](./homework/) after each lesson. This will provide you with practical experience in decision trees and random forests. Keep exploring!
