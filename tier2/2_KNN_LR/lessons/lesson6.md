## Objective
By the end of this lesson, you should understand how to evaluate the performance of KNN models and be familiar with techniques to enhance their predictions.

<a name="evaluation-metrics"></a>
## Evaluation Metrics for Classification
Evaluating the performance of a classification model is crucial. Common metrics include:
- **Accuracy:** Ratio of correctly predicted instances to the total instances.
- **Precision, Recall, and F1-Score:** Useful for imbalanced datasets.
- **Confusion Matrix:** Provides a matrix as output and tells us the true positive, true negative, false positive, and false negative.

## Improving KNN Performance
Several techniques can enhance the performance of a KNN model:
- **Feature Scaling:** Standardizing or normalizing features to bring them to a similar scale.
- **Dimensionality Reduction:** Techniques like PCA can be used to reduce the number of features.
- **Weighted Voting:** Instead of simple majority voting, consider the distance of neighbors.

## Conclusion
Evaluating and improving the performance of a KNN model is an iterative process. By understanding the metrics and techniques, you can refine your model to make more accurate predictions.
