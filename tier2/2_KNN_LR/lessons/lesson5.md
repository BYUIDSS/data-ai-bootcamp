## Objective
By the end of this lesson, you should be able to implement the KNN algorithm both from scratch and using the `sklearn` library.

<a name="knn-from-scratch"></a>
## KNN from Scratch
Here, we'll guide you through the steps to implement KNN from scratch. This will help you understand the inner workings of the algorithm.

<a name="knn-sklearn"></a>
## KNN with `sklearn`
`sklearn` is a powerful library that provides simple tools for data analysis. We'll explore how to use `sklearn` to implement KNN in just a few lines of code.

<a name="conclusion"></a>
## Conclusion
Implementing KNN both from scratch and with `sklearn` provides a comprehensive understanding of the algorithm. In the next lesson, we'll explore how to evaluate and improve our KNN models.
