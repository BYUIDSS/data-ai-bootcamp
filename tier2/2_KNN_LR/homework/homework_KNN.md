# Homework Assignments for Lessons 4-6

## Instructions
For all coding assignments, please use [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) notebooks. Ensure you share the link to your public notebook when submitting your assignments.

## Lesson 4: Introduction to KNN

### Assignment 4.1: Research
- **Task:** Research the history and applications of the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm.
- **Deliverable:** Write a one-page summary of your findings.

### Assignment 4.2: Understanding KNN
- **Task:** Explain the concept of "neighbor" in the context of KNN and how the algorithm uses these neighbors to make predictions.
- **Deliverable:** A brief report or a Google Colab notebook detailing your explanation with visual aids if necessary.

## Lesson 5: Implementing KNN

### Assignment 5.1: Code Implementation
- **Task:** Implement KNN from scratch using the provided Python code from the lesson in a Google Colab notebook.
- **Deliverable:** Share the link to your public Colab notebook showcasing your implementation and a brief summary of the results.

### Assignment 5.2: `sklearn` Implementation
- **Task:** Using the `sklearn` library, implement KNN on a dataset of your choice in a Google Colab notebook.
- **Deliverable:** Share the link to your public Colab notebook showcasing your `sklearn` implementation, along with a comparison of results between the from-scratch method and `sklearn`.

## Lesson 6: Evaluating and Improving KNN

### Assignment 6.1: Evaluation Metrics
- **Task:** For the models you implemented in Lesson 5, calculate relevant evaluation metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall) in a Google Colab notebook.
- **Deliverable:** Share the link to your public Colab notebook detailing the evaluation metrics for each model and an interpretation of the results.

### Assignment 6.2: Model Improvement
- **Task:** Experiment with different values of `k` and distance metrics (e.g., Euclidean, Manhattan) to improve the performance of your KNN model in a Google Colab notebook.
- **Deliverable:** Share the link to your public Colab notebook showcasing the improved models, a comparison of their performance against the original models, and a summary of your findings.

### Bonus Assignment: Advanced KNN Techniques
- **Task:** Research and implement an advanced KNN technique or variant (e.g., weighted KNN) in a Google Colab notebook.
- **Deliverable:** Share the link to your public Colab notebook detailing the technique, its benefits, implementation, results, and any insights or conclusions drawn from the exercise.
