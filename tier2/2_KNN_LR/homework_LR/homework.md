# Homework Assignments for Lessons 1-3

## Instructions
For all coding assignments, please use Google Colab notebooks. Ensure you share the link to your public notebook when submitting your assignments.

## Lesson 1: Introduction to Linear Regression

### Assignment 1.1: Research
- **Task:** Research the history and applications of Linear Regression.
- **Deliverable:** Write a one-page summary of your findings.

### Assignment 1.2: Data Collection
- **Task:** Find a dataset online that can be used for linear regression. This dataset should have at least one independent variable and one dependent variable.
- **Deliverable:** Provide a link to the dataset and a brief description of its contents.

## Lesson 2: Implementing Linear Regression

### Assignment 2.1: Code Implementation
- **Task:** Implement linear regression from scratch using the provided Python code from the lesson in a Google Colab notebook.
- **Deliverable:** Share the link to your public Colab notebook showcasing your implementation and a brief summary of the results.

### Assignment 2.2: `sklearn` Implementation
- **Task:** Using the `sklearn` library, implement linear regression on the same dataset you used in Assignment 1.2 in a Google Colab notebook.
- **Deliverable:** Share the link to your public Colab notebook showcasing your `sklearn` implementation, along with a comparison of results between the from-scratch method and `sklearn`.

## Lesson 3: Evaluating and Improving Linear Regression Models

### Assignment 3.1: Evaluation Metrics
- **Task:** For the models you implemented in Lesson 2, calculate the MAE, MSE, and RMSE in a Google Colab notebook.
- **Deliverable:** Share the link to your public Colab notebook detailing the evaluation metrics for each model and an interpretation of the results.

### Assignment 3.2: Model Improvement
- **Task:** Experiment with at least two techniques for improving your linear regression model, such as feature scaling, feature selection, or regularization in a Google Colab notebook.
- **Deliverable:** Share the link to your public Colab notebook showcasing the improved models, a comparison of their performance against the original models, and a summary of your findings.

### Bonus Assignment: Real-world Application
- **Task:** Find a real-world problem in your domain of interest where linear regression can be applied. Implement a linear regression model in a Google Colab notebook and evaluate its performance.
- **Deliverable:** Share the link to your public Colab notebook detailing the problem, dataset, implementation, results, and any insights or conclusions drawn from the exercise.
