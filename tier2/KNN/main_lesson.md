# K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Lessons

Welcome to the K-Nearest Neighbors module. Here, you'll explore the KNN algorithm, a simple yet powerful classification algorithm. Here's a brief overview:

- [Lesson 1: Introduction to KNN](./lessons/lesson1.md): Learn about the KNN algorithm, how it works, and its applications.

- [Lesson 2: Implementing KNN](./lessons/lesson2.md): Implement the KNN algorithm from scratch and learn how to use KNN with sklearn, a popular machine learning library in Python.

- [Lesson 3: Evaluating and Improving KNN](./lessons/lesson3.md): Understand how to evaluate the performance of a KNN model and explore techniques to improve it.

Don't forget to complete the [homework assignments](./homework/) after each lesson. This will help you get hands-on experience with the KNN algorithm. Happy learning!
