# Advanced AI Topics Lessons

Welcome to the Advanced AI Topics module. This module will round off your learning in Tier 2 with advanced topics such as transfer learning, reinforcement learning, and natural language processing. Here's a brief outline:

- [Lesson 1: Introduction to Transfer Learning](./lessons/lesson1.md): Understand the concept of transfer learning and how it's used to leverage pre-trained models in machine learning.

- [Lesson 2: Reinforcement Learning Basics](./lessons/lesson2.md): Learn about the basics of reinforcement learning, an area of machine learning where an agent learns to behave in an environment by performing actions and receiving rewards.

- [Lesson 3: Basics of Natural Language Processing](./lessons/lesson3.md): Dive into the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP), a branch of AI that helps computers understand, interpret, and manipulate human language.

- [Lesson 4: Advanced Topics in NLP](./lessons/lesson4.md): Delve deeper into NLP by exploring topics like sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, and language generation.

After completing the lessons, remember to do the [homework assignments](./homework/) to reinforce what you've learned. This will give you practical experience with these advanced AI topics. Happy learning!
