Welcome to the Inferential Statistics module. Here, you'll learn how to make predictions about a population based on a sample of data. This includes hypothesis testing, regression analysis, and more. Here's a brief outline:

- [Lesson 1: Introduction to Inferential Statistics](./lessons/lesson1.md): Get an overview of inferential statistics, its importance, and its applications.

- [Lesson 2: Hypothesis Testing](./lessons/lesson2.md): Learn about the concept of hypothesis testing, its procedure, and different types of tests.

- [Lesson 3: Regression Analysis](./lessons/lesson3.md): Dive into regression analysis, understand its principles, and learn how to perform regression in Python.

Don't forget to reinforce your learning by doing the [homework assignments](./homework/) after each lesson. Through this, you'll gain hands-on experience in inferential statistics. Happy learning!
