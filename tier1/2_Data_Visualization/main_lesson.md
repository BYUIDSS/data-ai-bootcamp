# Data Visualization Lessons

Welcome to the Data Visualization module. Visual storytelling is an essential part of data analysis. Through this module, you'll learn how to create insightful and interactive plots that can help reveal trends, patterns, and correlations in your data. Here's an overview of the lessons:

- [Lesson 1: Introduction to Data Visualization](./lessons/lesson1.md): Learn about the importance of data visualization and the key principles to effective visual storytelling.

- [Lesson 2: Basic Plots with Matplotlib](./lessons/lesson2.md): Get started with Matplotlib, a widely-used data visualization library in Python. We'll cover basic plots like line plots, scatter plots, and bar plots.

- [Lesson 3: Advanced Plots and Seaborn](./lessons/lesson3.md): Dive deeper into more complex visualizations and explore the Seaborn library which is built on top of Matplotlib.

After you've completed all the lessons, remember to work on the [homework assignments](./homework/). By doing so, you'll solidify your understanding and gain practical experience with data visualization. Happy visualizing!
