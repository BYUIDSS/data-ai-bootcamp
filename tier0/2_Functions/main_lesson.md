# Function Lessons

Welcome to the Function module, the next step in your programming journey. In this module, you'll get familiar with more advance basic structures of coding. Below is a brief overview of what each lesson covers:

- [Lesson 1: Variables](./lessons/lesson1.md): Understand what variables are, how they are used in programming, and the various types of variables you'll encounter.

- [Lesson 2: Data Types](./lessons/lesson2.md): Learn about different data types in programming like integers, floats, strings, and booleans. You'll also understand when to use which data type.

- [Lesson 3: Loops](./lessons/lesson3.md): Explore the concept of loops - the way we handle repetitive tasks in programming. We'll look at different types of loops like for loops, while loops, and more.

- [Lesson 4: Control Structures](./lessons/lesson4.md): Dive into control structures which allow your program to make decisions. This lesson will cover if statements, else statements, and switch cases.

These lessons are designed to be worked through in order, as each concept builds on the previous one. After you've completed all the lessons, apply what you've learned by completing the [homework assignments](./homework/). These exercises will help reinforce your understanding and give you practical experience with the concepts you've learned.

Remember, programming is a practical skill, and the best way to learn is by doing. Don't be afraid to experiment with the code examples and try the exercises. Happy coding!
