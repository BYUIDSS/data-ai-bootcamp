# Tier 0: Basic Coding

Welcome to Tier 0 of our Coding Bootcamp - Basic Coding. This tier serves as your stepping stone into the world of programming, laying down a strong foundational knowledge of the most essential coding concepts. Here's what you will learn:

- **[Fundamentals](./Fundamentals/main_lesson.md)**: You'll begin with understanding the basics of programming. This includes learning about variables, data types, loops, and control structures. You'll be writing simple programs to get hands-on experience with these concepts.

- **[Functions](./Functions/main_lesson.md)**: From the declaration of functions to understanding parameters, return values, and scope, you'll delve deep into the concept of functions in programming. Functions are reusable pieces of code that make your programs more modular and easier to understand.

- **[Data Structures](./Data_Structures/main_lesson.md)**: Arrays, lists, dictionaries, or similar structures depending on the language you're learning - this module will provide a strong understanding of these critical tools.

- **[Object-Oriented Programming](./Classes/main_lesson.md)**: Dive into classes, objects, inheritance, encapsulation, and more. Object-oriented programming is a design philosophy that uses a different set of programming languages features to make software development more manageable and less complex.

- **[Advanced Topics](./Advanced_Topics/main_lesson.md)**: Round off Tier 0 with advanced topics like exception handling, file I/O, and basic data structures and algorithms. This will equip you with an expanded skill set and a broader perspective on programming.

Each of these modules will have its own `main_lesson.md` file, linking to individual lesson files, along with homework and solutions. This is to ensure that you not only learn the theory but also apply it practically. You'll be doing plenty of coding, which is the best way to learn programming.
