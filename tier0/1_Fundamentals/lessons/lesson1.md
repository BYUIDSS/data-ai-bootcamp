# Lesson 1: Variables

Welcome to Lesson 1. In this lesson, we'll explore an essential concept in programming: variables. By the end of this lesson, you will understand what variables are, the role they play in programming, and how to use them effectively.

## What are Variables?

Variables in programming are used to store information that can be referenced and manipulated in a computer program. They provide a way of labeling data with a descriptive name, so our programs can be understood more clearly by the reader and ourselves. In essence, variables are containers for storing data values.

## Declaring Variables

In most programming languages, you can declare a variable using a simple notation. Typically, you'll provide a name for the variable and then assign it a value.

Here's an example in Python:

```python
x = 5
name = "John"
```

In the above example, **'x'** and **'name'** are variables. **'x'** is storing an integer value **'5'**, and **'name'** is storing a string value **'"John"'**.


## Rules for Naming Variables

Each programming language has its own set of rules for naming variables, but there are some common practices. Most importantly, variable names should be descriptive of the data they hold. A variable name like **'user_age'** is more readable than a vague name like **'x'**.

## Types of Variables

Variables can hold different types of values, such as numbers, text (strings), and more complex types like lists and objects. The type of a variable is generally determined by the kind of data you assign to it.

## Using Variables

Once you've declared a variable, you can use it in your program. You can perform operations on variables, use them in functions, and more. Here's an example:

```python
x = 5
y = 10
z = x + y  # z is now 15
```

## Conclusion

Understanding variables is foundational to learning programming. As you proceed through these lessons, you'll find variables are a key part of almost every piece of code you write. Remember, variables are a way to label and store data in your programs, making your code more readable and flexible.
