# Lesson 2: Data Types in Python

In Python, we categorize values into different _types_. Understanding these types and how to use them is essential for coding in Python.

## Integers and Floats

_Integers_ are whole numbers. They can be positive or negative.

_Floats_ (floating point numbers) are numbers with a decimal point. They can also be positive or negative.

In Python, we can perform basic arithmetic operations on integers and floats, like addition (`+`), subtraction (`-`), multiplication (`*`), and division (`/`).

```python
x = 10  # Integer
y = 3.14  # Float

# Addition
print(x + y)

# Subtraction
print(x - y)

# Multiplication
print(x * y)

# Division
print(x / y)
```

## Strings

A string is a sequence of characters. In Python, strings are enclosed in quotes. We can use either single quotes (''') or double quotes ('"'), as long as we use the same type to open and close the string.

```python
# Single quotes
s1 = 'Hello, world!'

# Double quotes
s2 = "Hello, world!"
```

## Boolean

A boolean represents one of two values: **True** or **False**. Booleans are often used in conditional statements, which we will cover in a future lesson.

```python
# Boolean values
t = True
f = False
```

## Conclusion

Understanding data types is crucial for manipulating data in Python. In the next lesson, we'll dive deeper into these types, learning about operations we can perform on them and how to convert between types.
